R-7.6 Suppose that x and y are references to nodes of circularly linked lists,
although not necessarily the same list. Describe a fast algorithm for telling
if x and y belong to the same list.

- Set initial = x
- Set walk = x.next

- If initial == y   # x and y are the same
    - return True

- while walk != initial
    # check if walk is equal to y
    if walk == y
        return True

    walk = walk.next

- Return False
