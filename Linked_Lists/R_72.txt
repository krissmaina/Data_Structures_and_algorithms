R-7.2 Describe a good algorithm for concatenating two singly linked lists L and
M, given only references to the first node of each list, into a single list L'
that contains all the nodes of L followed by all the nodes of M.

- set walk_l to be the head of L
- while walk_l.next is not None
    walk_l = walk_l.next (go to the next node)
walk_l is the last node of L

- set walk_m to be the head of M
- while walk_m.next is not None
    add walk to singly linked list L
