R-7.1 Give an algorithm for finding the second-to-last node in a singly linked
list in which the last node is indicated by a next reference of None.

- If len(list) < 2
    raise Exception(List does not have enough elements)

- Let walk be the head of the singly linked list

- while walk.next.next is not None
     walk = walk.next

- return walk
